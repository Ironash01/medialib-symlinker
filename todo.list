bug 01A
find out why the goddamn hatsune miku magical mirai 2020 returned 2019 and why the 2020 in the got removed. FOR FUCKS SAKE [solved]
    cause:
        it was an error back in the sed syntax
bug02A
fix grep commands having conflict when the "$file" has S01-S[0-9]*
    cause:
        when grep -m 1 -x -v -F 'file_basename' matches it matches the first string that is not the base directory and then limit it to one.
        if a Season number matches a base directory name e.g.: Season 5 when the base directory is showname.S01-S05 it counts every directory technically.
        therefore, the first output, which is showname.S01-S05/Season 1/ will result instead of showname.SO1-S05/Season 5/
