Implemenent sorting specials episodes. ( by default no skipping will be done)

running medialib -q run will read the files from tmdb/Extras and place them inside tmdb/Specials so medialib -q run should only be executed after medialib -C

Users would neet to add specials keyword by medialib -q <add:|remove:|list> <keyword> and remove by medialib list by medialib

Default keywords: OVA, Specials, 

To add keywords

medialib -q select
medialib -q select | grep <show here>

The 'select' argument of -q tells the program that it is setting this keyword for a specific show already registered in our current config.
The select will issue a prompt which then Users would be required to enter the name of their show. The subshell run by the script would change directory into 

medialib -q add <keyword> e.g. medialib -q add 'Depth of Field' -q epnum 7-13 

This will add 'Depth of Field' as specials keyword to the current show and then after that and tell the program that those episode are S00E07 to S00E13 respectively.


How about normal specials such as those marked with OVA, Specials, S00 already?
They get sorted obviously, by alphabetically.

To modify the episode numbers


OVA
S00
Specials

medialib -q select 
	prompt: show here (with autocomletion)

medialib -q add OVA -q ep 1-5:skip:skip:skip

The ":" character will tell it to skip specific episode numbering
e.g. you want to set OVA to ep 01-05 but ep 04 is actually a recap in the tmdb list
syntax :num:num

medialib -q add OVA -q ep 1-5 -q skip 4

the "add" argument on q will add keywords and if it exists will replace them accordingly.
